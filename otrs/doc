So i wanted to install OTRS in a freenas jail

quite eays i thought:


create jail from webGUI
jexec into the gui and do a
pkg search otrs
and 
pkg install  otrs-5.0.10
afterwoods i realized that i had a database client but no database so i had to do a
pkg search mysql56
and 
pkg install  mysql56-server-5.6.33

now it is time to configure mysql according to the manual ( fro OTRS) 



and i found this
https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/23765/
nice write up which is currently my secind source;
my cgi is not beeing served don't know yet why...

after some fiddling around i get an error 500 both for /cgi-bin/test-cgi and for /otrs/installer.pl
the first one i was able to fix by 
pkg install bash-4.3.46_1
now at least this works but i don't remember what i did to get cgi to run in the first place



so i got my test cgi to run
and after unsetting the User www option it ran my skript too;
so i just reeinstalled both

and after i ran the permissions skript it ran


and now i will do the gui setup

now i am getting gateway timeouts while setting up the database (EG crating the tables)

so i will just drop the db again and retry from another computer

https://otrs.github.io/doc/manual/admin/3.3/en/html/manual-installation-of-otrs.html
it seems to be able to run with this

cpan install Log::Log4perl

so lets fix my db mess with a central db server
###
#my.conf
###
#added


user            = mysql
#pid-file        = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
#socket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
port            = 3306
#basedir         = /usr
#datadir         = /var/lib/mysql
#tmpdir          = /tmp
#language        = /usr/share/mysql/English
bind-address    = x.x.x.x
# skip-networking

####

lets start mysql
mysql
use mysql;
create user otrs identified by 'PASS';       
update user set host='%' where host='localhost' and user='otrs';
create database otrs;
grant all on otrs.* to user otrs;

#
that should be it


now lets fix the size options
add

max_allowed_packet   = 20M
query_cache_size     = 32M
innodb_log_file_size = 256M

to my.cnf

add

#so now open your web installer
#and it crashed because of shm again
#add to the jail options
allow.sysvipc=true

#drop the old db and recreate it empty;
#web installer worked til step three
#so i am further now than originally

#now lets setup
 
#ok it worked i have an admin acocunt;
#but i had to add another cpan package but i added this in the script before
#add otrs to the ww group
pw group mod www -M otrs
su otrs
/usr/local/otrs/bin/otrs.Daemon.pl start
/usr/local/otrs/bin/Cron.sh start
# was not able to setup the bash completion




#to setup pgp i changed the webserver to runs as user otrs
